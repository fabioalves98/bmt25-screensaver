## Retro DVD screensaver ðŸ“€

After re-watching The Office for the nth time, I decided to recreate this piece of pop culture classic as my first JavaScript project. 

**Short history:**

The bouncing DVD logo was introduced by the international organization DVD Forum and DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation, a Tokyo-based international company established in the year 2000 with the purpose of standardizing the DVD format.

While it could be found in any home with a DVD player, it definitely gained notoriety when it became the subject of a popular cold open on the American mockumentary sitcom TV series, *The Office*, episode "Launch Party".

### Features of the bouncing DVD logo: 

* Responsive scaling when the window is resized
* The DVD logo is an SVG asset that:
	* changes to a random color as it hits the edge of the window
	* starts blinking as it hits the window corner
* Custom sound effects for hitting the edge of the window and when hitting the window corner
